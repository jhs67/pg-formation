# pg-formation

Node.js stateful database schema management tool built exclusively for postgres.

With many migration tools you specify the changes to your schema.
With pg-formation you specify the final schema and pg-formation infers
the changes.

## Installation

	$ npm install pg-formation

Installing this module locally adds an executable file into your `node_modules/.bin` directory.
Use node_modules/.bin/pg-formation to run the program if installed this way. You can use
the `-g` option to `npm` to install globally and use `pg-formation` to run the program.
